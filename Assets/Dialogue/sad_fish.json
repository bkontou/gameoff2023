    "Why? Well look at me, look at where I am. Just some small squat fish down here on the bottom of the ocean surrounded by bigger fish who are all out to eat me.",
    "Why can't I be one of those up there? With all the nice colors, getting to eat all the plankton I want",
    "Or one of those big guys, hanging out with his friends and eating any small fish he comes across?",
    "Ohhhhh, why must I be born in this pathetic frail body?",
    "Every day I pray to neptune that I'm reborn as a powerful swordfish, or perhaps a majestic flying fish.",
    "Hey, you ever heard of the old fish-theory of reincarnation? Maybe in my next life I'll come back as a beautiful damselfish.",
    "Okay, it's settled. Take a nice big bite out of me so I can come back as something better",

    "WAIT!",
