    "Hey, why the long face?",

    "Hey come on man, it's just a joke! What's with you bottom feeders? Always down in the dumps.",
    "Hahaa, okay okay, that's the last one. Really, bottom feeders like us gotta keep our spirits up somehow.",
    "Oh, yeah those big guys out there are fine so long as they don't flip you onto your back to get at your soft underbelly.",
    "Well, I guess that doesn't apply to you. But you probably have some other kind of defense. Maybe. Honestly I don't know what you are.",
    "And, if all else fails, maybe just accept the idea of dying. I hear dying isn't even half as bad as they say it is.",
    "I mean, how can we, being as alive as we are, even say anything? You only ever hear about how bad death is from those still living.",
    "Let's leave some room for the dead to chime in on this, then we'll see how bad it really is.",
    "I mean, my friend died just the other day and he hasn't complained once!"
