	"Woah, hey, talk about a face only a mother could love.",
	"I kid, I kid. You've got a nice... uh... scales.",
	"What? No! I love bottom feeders! Some of my best friends are bottom feeders!",
	"Just... Y'know... Not into that certain lifestyle. No offense of course.",
	"What am I doing down here then? Fair enough question. I didn't mean to come all the way down here.",
	"I was actually on my way to my cousin's reef. Bit of a shithole there but it's nice to visit from time to time.",
	"But man, the way he talks about it you'd think he lives in the great barrier.",
	"Anyway, I was taking the southern current down since at this point I'm already late because my hungry ass wanted to stop for some algae.",
	"So I'm hauling ass down this current and I don't even notice this massive jellyfish. Ran right into his stingers.",
	"Luckily I've grown a tolerance by microdosing jellyfish venom for the past three years ever since my ex left me for a sturgeon.",
        "Don't ask why, just thought it was going to be a more common occurrence if I become some kind of badass spy or something.",
	"Anyway, so because of my years of training I manage to wriggle out of his grasp, but, sadly, it leaves me with just enough energy to limply float down here.",
	"Don't worry about me though! I'm just resting for a bit. Then its right back up to the reef.",
	"Well. Hopefully. A couple of dudes out here look pretty mean. But nothing I can't handle. I'm not scared at all.",
	"Honestly, I hope they try something. Finally get to try the ninjutsu I've practiced for 2 years ever since my other ex left me for a sunfish."
