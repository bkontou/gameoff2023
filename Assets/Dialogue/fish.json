    "Oh, hello. I didn't see you there.",

    "Oh, no, this isn't my usual place. I've recently just moved in down here after... well...",
    "I guess it's not that hard to tell I'm in a bit of a predicament here.",
    "But please, don't worry about me! This is how it is here. No use fighting it.",
    "Not that I really could. Pretty soon I'll be dead. Only living on in the memory of my friends and family closer to the surface.",
    "But what a terrible fate. You die, and your ghost is kept around in every memory of you in the living world. Being kept half-alive in the thoughts of those still kicking up there.",
    "No, I think you're only truly at peace when the last memory of you is erased from existence. Nothing short of total annihilation could possibly let you rest soundly.",
    "Anyway, enough of what I think. I suppose you'll want to eat me now."
